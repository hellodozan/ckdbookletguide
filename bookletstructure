# Booklet Structure Information

This booklet does not have a fixed page count. As long as it remains informative, I plan to design more content based on the information provided. However, for each series, I will limit the pages to 10-15 to ensure that CKD patients can easily understand the content.

The booklet will consist of 70% graphics and 30% text to make it more accessible and easier to comprehend.

## Series One
General Habit Guide
This series is intended for CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis once or twice a week. It includes general information, tips, guides, and important alerts.
