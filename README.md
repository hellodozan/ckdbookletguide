# This project was initiated by me in November 2024.

This is a freeware project, meaning anyone who wants to contribute can add information to it.
The purpose of this project is to create a _guide for CKD patients to live better lives._

I have two years of experience as a caregiver for CKD patients, and I want to share what caregivers can do to help and what CKD patients can do for themselves.
I'm really excited about this project, and I hope it can help many people with CKD.
